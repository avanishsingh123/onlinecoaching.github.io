                <p class="sectionsubtag small-text">he education sector or education system is a group of institutions
                    (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools,
                    universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in
                    educational settings. It involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school
                    principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to
                    different
                    contexts.
                    Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various
                    elements
                    such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and
                    learning
                    materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes.</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag small-text">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain
                    aims,
                    such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                    development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
                    role
                    of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require
                    that
                    education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of
                    the
                    term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the
                    product of
                    this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated
                    as
                    the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                    increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern
                    society,
                    empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag small-text">Education is a powerful driver of development and one of the

                    instruments for reducing poverty and improving health, gender equality, peace, and stability.
                    Developing
                    countries have made tremendous progress in getting children into the classroom and the majority of
                    children worldwide are now in primary school. Nevertheless, some 260 million children are still out
                    of
                    primary and secondary school.Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                    knowledge
                    and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally
                    and
                    through imitation.</p>
